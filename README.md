# scand-ai — Memory With a Receipt

Team **scand-ai** · RELEX Solutions challenge track · AaltoAI Hackathon 2026

## The problem in one paragraph

Two years into a software rollout, nobody agrees on what was decided. There are 45
documents — 23 Teams transcripts, 20 email threads, 2 status-report threads — and the
people who were in the room have changed jobs. Ask a normal AI assistant to "summarise
what was agreed" and you get a clean, confident, wrong answer: a reversed decision
reported as current, a consultant's suggestion reported as a customer agreement, a record
that was never true repeated as fact.

We are building an agent that answers the same questions and can **show its receipts**.

The archive is invented — Acme Org is a fictional EMEA grocery retailer, and no RELEX
customer data is involved. RELEX is named throughout it and the record is unflattering
about how the vendor handled things. That is deliberate: the right answer is what the
record says, not the polite version.

## What the agent has to do

| # | Requirement | Our position |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Cite everything** — document, and where in it | In scope for the MVP. Every claim carries document, location, and the verbatim span it came from. No citation means we treat it as a guess. |
| 2 | **Suggestion ≠ commitment** | In scope. Extraction records what kind of speech act a statement is, who made it, and for whom they spoke. |
| 3 | **Know stale from wrong** | Out of scope for the MVP; a second-pass LLM layer that groups and evaluates statements is the agreed successor. See [D4](docs/decisions.md) and [D16](docs/decisions.md). |
| 4 | **Delete a person** | In scope, with a deliberate and documented interpretation. See [D3](docs/decisions.md) and [D19](docs/decisions.md). |
| 5 | **Do one thing unasked** | Not yet chosen — [Q1](docs/open-questions.md). Candidates and evidence in [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md). |
| — | **Residency** — the archive stays in the EU | In scope and structural: Verda, local Ollama, no external model APIs. See [architecture](docs/architecture.md#residency). |

Scoring weights, how the judges test it, and what we have to hand in on Sunday:
[docs/challenge.md](docs/challenge.md).

## How it works

Three long-running containers and one job that runs once.

1. **The pile.** 45 plain-text documents, read-only. We never edit them. What is in them,
   and the traps they contain: [docs/corpus.md](docs/corpus.md).
2. **Statement extraction (job).** Walks the documents one at a time, puts each through a
   local LLM, and pulls out every statement it contains — who said it, when, what kind of
   claim it was, and exactly where in the document it appears. The results from all
   documents are aggregated into a single statements file. This runs once, offline.
3. **Backend.** A Python/FastAPI service that takes a user question, puts the statements
   file in the model's context, and answers from it — with citations.
4. **Frontend.** A Streamlit app the judges open in a browser and use themselves.

Full picture, including what each boundary is for: [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

reference.

## Working in this repo

Python everywhere, `uv` for dependencies and running things, one container per service.
Read [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) before your first commit — it is short, and the rules in it
are the ones that protect our score.

## Running the whole thing

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

On a laptop that is all of it: no flags, no `.env`, CPU only, and a small model
(`qwen3:0.6b`, ~520 MB) pulled automatically. Enough to prove the wiring end to end, and
nothing at all about answer quality.

The VM is the same command plus three environment variables, set once in Coolify:

```
OLLAMA_RUNTIME=nvidia                    # stock runtime ignores the GPU without this
OLLAMA_DATA_DIR=/root/ollama-data        # bind the weights already on disk
LLM_MODEL=qwen3.8:27b-mtp-bf16           # also drives extraction unless overridden
```

Set none of them and you get the laptop stack; set **all three** and you get the real one.
They are independent, so a partial set runs in a half-state rather than failing — a 27B
model on CPU will crawl, not error, and a missing `OLLAMA_DATA_DIR` silently re-downloads
tens of gigabytes it already has. The `ollama-pull` job prints the configuration it
resolved and warns on both of those, so check the top of its deploy log
([D26](docs/decisions.md)).

`OLLAMA_RUNTIME=nvidia` needs a *named* `nvidia` runtime registered with the Docker daemon.
`docker run --gpus all` working does not prove that — `--gpus` takes a different code path.
Verify with `docker info | grep -A3 -i runtimes`, and if it is missing, run
`sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker && sudo systemctl restart docker`. See
[decision D25](docs/decisions.md).

Statement extraction runs first; the backend and the frontend do not start until it has
finished and exited. The UI is then on <http://localhost:8501>. The backend is not
published — it is reachable from inside the compose network only, which is what
[architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) asks for.

Ollama runs as a fourth container on the same VM, on the GPU only when
`OLLAMA_RUNTIME=nvidia` is set. A one-shot `ollama-pull` job downloads the model into the
model store (a named volume on a laptop, the `OLLAMA_DATA_DIR` bind on the VM) before
extraction or the backend start, so the first question can never hit a missing model; a
re-pull of a model that is already there is a no-op, so only the first run is slow. Both models are configuration —
`LLM_MODEL` for answering, `EXTRACTION_LLM_MODEL` for extraction, the latter defaulting to
the former. See [decision D23](docs/decisions.md) for the Ollama service and
[D25](docs/decisions.md) for the laptop/VM switch.

## Status

**Extraction, answering and deletion all run end to end.** Statement extraction reads the
45-document archive with a local Ollama model and writes the statements file; the backend
answers questions from that file with citations; deletion resolves a person, redacts every
spelling everywhere it occurs — including verbatim spans — and the frontend can trigger it
from a dialog on the page, no restart required. 96 tests pass across the two services
(64 in `statement_extraction`, 32 in `backend`, including 30 covering deletion alone).

Still open, and tracked in [docs/open-questions.md](docs/open-questions.md): the
initiative feature, who answers the nine practice questions, which EU region the Verda VM
is in — residency is enforced structurally (local model, no external APIs) even without a
named region — and what stops re-extraction or our own tooling from undoing a deletion.
See [docs/decisions.md](docs/decisions.md) for the full log, D1 through D48.

## My contributions

Branches [`shah/extraction-pipeline`](../../tree/shah/extraction-pipeline) and
[`shah/deletion`](../../tree/shah/deletion):

- **Statement extraction** — corpus parsers for all three document genres, a verbatim-span
  matcher that only accepts a quote if it is actually present in the source unit, the
  Ollama extraction call, and the agreement-linking pass that gives every `agreed_by` entry
  its own receipt statement (D16–D22). Later ported and adapted onto the main branch's
  contracts by a teammate (D28).
- **Deletion** — resolving a person to every surface form they appear under (including a
  planted spelling split and two people sharing a first name), redacting each one across
  actor fields, agreed-by parties and verbatim spans, and returning a receipt naming who was
  removed and who was deliberately left (D37/D42); the CLI command that applies it to the
  statements file in place (D38/D43); and making the backend re-read the statements file on
  every request so a deletion shows without a restart (D39/D44).

Moving deletion into the backend service, the `/delete` endpoint, the deletion dialog in the
frontend, and the later rebase onto a regrouped statements file (D45–D47) were built by a
teammate on top of this work.
